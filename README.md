# Cal Poly's STAT 431: Advanced Statistical Computing with R
This repository contains my output as I follow [Dr. Kelly Bodwin](https://twitter.com/KellyBodwin) and [Dr. Hunter Glanz](https://twitter.com/hglanz)'s public-facing version of a STAT 431 at Cal Poly.

From the course's [website](https://cal-poly-advanced-r.github.io/STAT-431/): 
> **Course Description**  
Advanced techniques for efficient use of computers to perform statistical computations and to analyze large amounts of data. Includes version control systems; tools supporting reproducibility; functional programming; randomization and bootstrapping; dynamic data visualizations; and R package development. <br>  
Disclaimer: This is not an Advanced R Programming course for developers. Rather, it is a second-year course for advanced uses of R in Data Science and Statistics.
